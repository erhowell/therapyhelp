# therapyhelp

Theray help is a project made for the Utah State University Hack-a-thon. The premise of the project was to make a website that a user can search for a professional listed in on the site and schedule an appointment. This idea is similar to betterhelp.com. For this project I had to learn how to set up a local server and a database and php. I also had to learn how to be an effective project manager in a team  of 4. Many of whom had little to no experience with web development. We started the project around 5pm and ended the project at around 1pm the next day.
